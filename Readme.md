Please you can aviliable to suggest us, thank you!!

This dataset recorded chronic migraine (CM), a disabling headache disorder, patient's electroencephalogram (EEG).[1]

Methods : Patients with CM were recruited, along with age- and gender-matched healthy controls (CTLs). The time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear metrics of HRV were calculated to evaluate the sympathetic and parasympathetic aspects of ANS function in patients with CM before and after 3-month (12 weeks) treatment with flunarizine as well as in CTLs. The patients were asked to keep a headache diary throughout the study period to determine the treatment efficacy.[2]

Data: EEG change after treatment [ Time Frame: 4 months ]
Linear and nonlinear analysis of EEG before and after treatment
Three EEG session will be arranged. The first one is done before treatment, and the 2nd/3rd one will be done after a 2-month/4-month treatment course, respectively.
The EEG analyses include linear (eg: power spectrum, coherence, functional connectivity) analyses as well as non-linear (eg: entropy) analyses.[3]

Here is not only further information can be gotten from EEG, but also the experiment of paradigm can let you know the whole process.
